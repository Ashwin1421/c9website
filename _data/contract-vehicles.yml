                multiple-award, indefinite-delivery/indefinite quantity 
                (IDIQ), Government-wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) reserved 
                solely for 8(a) certified small businesses. It is engineered 
                to provide federal agencies cutting-edge information technology 
                (IT) solutions from award-winning 8(a) small businesses like 
                Cloud Nine Technologies, prequalified by GSA to perform the 
                work, and allows for long-term planning of large-scale program 
                requirements. STARS II enables agencies to earn not only 8(a), 
                but multiple socioeconomic credits possessed by Cloud Nine 
                through an established contract vehicle instead of traditional, 
                open market methods – saving substantial time and taxpayer money.

                <h5>EASE IN BECOMING A STARS II ORDERING CONTRACTING OFFICER (OCO)</h5>
                Prior to issuing orders under 8(a) STARS II, federal contracting 
                officers are required to receive training on the use of the 8(a) 
                STARS II contract from the GSA Small Business GWAC Center and be 
                granted a written Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA). 
                Training can be obtained in as little as one to two hours at no cost via:
                <ul>
                  <li>Webinar;</li>
                  <li>Self-paced, online training;</li>
                  <li>Conference call; or</li>
                  <li>Onsite training presented by GSA GWAC Center experts.</li>
                </ul>
                NOTE: DPA may be granted the same day, although typical cycle time 
                is two business days and many training sessions offer Continuous Learning Points.
                <h5>ORDERING OPTIONS</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Direct Acquisitions</b> – The agency requiring services uses its own 
                    internal acquisition capabilities / staff to procure services and is 
                    responsible for the entire acquisition.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Assisted Acquisitions</b> – One agency has the requirement but 
                    uses the services of another third party agency to procure the 
                    needed services. In an assisted acquisition socioeconomic 
                    credit for a prime contractor always goes to the funding agency.
