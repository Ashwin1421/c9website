                multiple-award, indefinite-delivery/indefinite quantity 
                (IDIQ), Government-wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) reserved 
                solely for 8(a) certified small businesses. It is engineered 
                to provide federal agencies cutting-edge information technology 
                (IT) solutions from award-winning 8(a) small businesses like 
                Cloud Nine Technologies, prequalified by GSA to perform the 
                work, and allows for long-term planning of large-scale program 
                requirements. STARS II enables agencies to earn not only 8(a), 
                but multiple socioeconomic credits possessed by Cloud Nine 
                through an established contract vehicle instead of traditional, 
                open market methods – saving substantial time and taxpayer money.
