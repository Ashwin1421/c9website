  content: "A federal grant is an award of financial assistance from a 
            federal agency to a recipient to carry out a public purpose 
            of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States. 
            Federal grant agencies have various types of grant programs defined 
            with tailored grants management processes for the pre-award through 
            the closeout stages of the corresponding grant program. 
            Cloud Nine Technologies Inc. has a strong understanding and experience 
            working with the grants management lifecycle processes associated with 
            formula as well as competitive grants. We have been actively involved 
            in the architecture, design and development of an enterprise-wide 
            grants management system. The system provides an end-to-end solution 
            for the various stages (pre-award, award, post-award and close-out) 
            of the grants management lifecycle processes starting from intake of 
            grant applications tailored for the corresponding grant program through 
            the funds administration processes for monitoring the grant program. 
            The system interfaces with Grants.gov for the intake of competitive 
            grant applications."

  content: "'Improper payments' occur when funds go to the wrong recipient, 
            the recipient receives the incorrect amount of funds (including 
            overpayments and underpayments), documentation is not available 
            to support a payment, or the recipient uses funds in an improper 
            manner. In fiscal year 2009, federal government outlays totaled 
            $3.5 trillion. Improper payments totaled $110 billion in FY 2009 
            (Source: http://paymentaccuracy.gov/).

            Cloud Nine Technologies Inc. has been actively working with the 
            Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the architecture, 
            design and development of an award-winning Enterprise Income Verification 
            (EIV) system to reduce the improper payments in HUDâ€™s rental housing 
            assistance programs for eligible low-income families, elders and 
            persons with disabilities. Through increased efficiency and accuracy 
            in the income and rent determinations, the system assures the participation 
            of eligible families and assists HUD in meeting the target improper 
            payment rates in its rental housing assistance programs."
